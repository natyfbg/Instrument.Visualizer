1. Introduction
The Instrument Visualizer Web App is an interactive web application developed in TypeScript. It allows users to explore and experience the visualizations of five different musical instruments in real-time. Whether you're a music enthusiast or a developer looking to expand your web development skills, this project offers a unique and engaging experience.

2. Prerequisites
Before you start working with the Instrument Visualizer Web App, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
3. Getting Started
Client
The client directory contains the frontend (UI) portion of this web application. You can run the client with the following commands:

npm start: Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Your app is ready to be deployed.

npm run prod: This command combines npm run build and python3 http.server. It starts a web server that hosts your app at http://localhost:3002, allowing you to interact with a live, production server.

Learn more about CRA (Create React App) in the Create React App documentation.

Server
The server directory contains the backend code included as a reference and pedagogical tool. You will run a version of the server locally for testing purposes and switch to talking to a production server when jamming with your classmates. To start the server, use the following command:

npm start: Runs the server in development mode. The server will restart if you make edits, and errors will be displayed in the console.
